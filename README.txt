FERNET the open source encryption project->

ENCRYPT, DECRYPT AND MANAGE FILES,
STATE: working; beta
HOW TO USE:
FIRSTLY, YOU NEED TO RUN "/NEW" EVERY TIME YOU USE IT,
GIVING THE FILE YOU WANT TO USE FOR THE REST OF YOUR SESION UNTIL YOU EXIT FERNET. IF YO WANT TO CHANGE FILE, SIMPLY TYPE "/NEW" AGAIN,


ERRORS MAY BE FIXED BY TYPING "/DELCACHE", UNLESS IT'S A TYPO ERROR, FOR MORE INFO CONTACT:
FOR ANY UNSOLVED ERRORS OR SUGGESTIONS, CONSULT ME AT: p4rtypi5@gmail.com.


THE INFO IN "\KEYINFO", IS THE INFORMATION THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE VARIABLES THAT COLECT THE INFORMATION INPUTTED, (THE VARIABLES GET DELETED ONCE THE SESION ENDS)
SO YOU WILL ONLY SEE WHAT YOU WROTE ON THAT SESION

EVERYTHING WILL BE STORED IN THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE MAIN SCRIPT IS ("fernet.py"), BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT WITH THE "/CHANGEDIR" COMMAND
